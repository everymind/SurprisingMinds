# Introduction

Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, a complex organ system inside every animal on planet Earth. Since its birth as a distinct scientific discipline in the 1950s and 1960s, neuroscience has concentrated its efforts on "interventionist" laboratory experiments with mice and rats, in which the experimenter manipulates some aspect of the nervous system and carefully observes the effects of that manipulation. This method has been very productive for the last 60 years, and has motivated the rapid development of ever more precise tools for physical and chemical manipulation of nervous system cells and molecules. Unfortunately, [these techniques have not been enough to meaningfully connect the cellular and molecular activity of nervous systems to the behaviour and well-being of whole organisms](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(16)31040-6.pdf). 

Several clues point to a need for neuroscience to expand its work out of the laboratory setting and "into the wild". Nervous systems evolved for millions of years into countless forms and in unknown, unpredictable environments before we built laboratories; yet, [the vast majority of brains we currently study are from only a few species which have been bred for generations in laboratory settings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2605402/pdf/fnana-02-005.pdf). [We are discovering that the differences between an anaesthetized brain, a brain in a restrained animal, and a brain in a freely moving animal can be profound, even when studying neuroscience topics other than movement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3184003/pdf/nihms-326476.pdf). We are also discovering that [nervous systems are incredibly sensitive to the details of both their immediate context and their past history](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5191967/pdf/nihms821426.pdf). These clues, and more, have motivated me and my colleagues in the [Intelligent Systems Lab](http://www.kampff-lab.org/) to search for ways to validate laboratory results and techniques under more natural conditions and with larger, more diverse samples of research subjects. 



# "Surprising Minds": an experiment embedded in an exhibit

"Surprising Minds" was installed next to the [cuttlefish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish) [display tank in the Victorian Arcade of the Sea Life Centre in Brighton](https://www.visitsealife.com/brighton/discover/aquarium-zones/) during the first week of July 2017. During July and August 2017, the exhibit was hosted by "host scientist", who invited visitors at the Sea Life Centre to interact with the exhibit, explained the experiment embedded in the exhibit, and engaged in discussions about neuroscience topics such as [optical illusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_illusion), [blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight), and the [structure of the retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina#Structure).
