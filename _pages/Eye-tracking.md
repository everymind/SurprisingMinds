## What is eye-tracking?

"Eye-tracking" is a term used to describe the study of eye movements. You usually use this method when you want to track the gaze of the eyes (i.e. where someone is looking), when you want to measure the motion of the eye relative to the head, or when you want to study changes to the pupil over time.
