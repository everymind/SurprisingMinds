Calling all scuba divers, marine researchers, and all other ocean enthusiasts! **If you have any short video clips of interesting behaviour by marine animals, which you would like to share with the visitors of Sea Life Brighton, please get in touch!** 

Now that our exhibit at the Sea Life Centre in Brighton has been running automatically since last October, we feel very confident in the stability of the technical and mechanical components of the exhibit. We've also, to date, recorded the eye movements of over 4000 visitors to the exhibit, and we'll be sharing some analysis on that dataset soon!

Given that, we would like to change the videos being shown in the exhibit. This will both allow us to showcase new and exciting footage of marine animal behaviour, and to ask new research questions about human eyes and visual perception! 

## So if you have videos of marine animals, or plan to record videos of them in the near future...

...please get in touch! 

We are more than happy to showcase videos of any of the many fascinating creatures in the ocean, but at the same time, we are particularly interested in videos of cephalopods, such as octopus, cuttlefish, and squid. We are also particularly interested in videos that showcase the following situations: 
 - behaviour happening outside of a laboratory environment, such as in an aquarium, display tank, fishery, tide pool, beach, or open ocean;
 - hunting or feeding behaviour;
 - cooperative behaviour, either between animals of the same species or between animals of different species; 
 - mating behaviour, or any sex-specific behaviour;
 - interactions between parents and children; and
 - interactions between marine animals and humans.
 
 If you have any such videos that you would like to share, please contact Danbee Kim at danbee[at]alum[dot]mit[dot]edu. We look forward to collaborating with you!
