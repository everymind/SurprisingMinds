In July 2017, we installed an interactive science exhibit at Sea Life Brighton in order to **protoype a new way to ask scientific questions about behaviour and the mind "in the wild"**. We hope that the exhibit will help us make topics in neuroscience and cognitive science more inclusive and accessible to the general public.

## What is 'intelligence'?

Intelligence is the power of brains to predict the world. It helps us learn what to expect next!

We use our expectations all the time by creating a model in our minds of "how things should work." Scientists call this your "model of the world"!

## How do we create our 'model of the world'?

We create our "model of the world" by collecting information about the world around us. While smells, sounds, tastes, feelings, and experiences are all part of our "model of the world", most of the information we collect comes through our eyes. 

## Do you know what your eyes do when you look at the world?

Looking is one of the first behaviours we develop as infants, long before we learn how to talk. But have you ever seen your own eyes up close, to see what they do when they collect information about the world around you? 

At the Surprising Minds exhibit, you can do exactly that! Come watch a 30-second video clip while we record your eyes up close. Then we'll replay the recording so that you can see what your eyes do when you watch movies, or look at the world!
