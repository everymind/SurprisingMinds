In July 2017, we installed an interactive science exhibit at Sea Life Brighton in order to **explore a new way to ask scientific questions about behaviour and the mind "in the wild"**. We hope that the exhibit will help us make research in neuroscience and cognitive science more inclusive and accessible to the general public. 

Our exhibit is located next to the cuttlefish display tank in the main arcade of Sea Life Brighton. Here we introduce Sea Life visitors to the main idea underlying **comparative neuroscience**: even brains that look totally different can evolve the same kinds of brain "powers", for example, the power of "intelligence". 

## What is 'intelligence'?

Intelligence is the power of brains to predict the world. It helps us learn what to expect next!

We use our expectations all the time by creating a model in our minds of "how things should work." Scientists call this your "model of the world".

## How do we create our 'model of the world'?

We create our "model of the world" by collecting information about the world around us. While smells, sounds, tastes, feelings, and experiences are all part of our "model of the world", the primary input device of human brains is our eyes. 

## What your eyes do when you create your 'model of the world'?

Looking is one of the first behaviours we develop as infants, long before we learn how to talk. But have you ever seen your own eyes up close, to see what they do when they collect information about the world around you? 

At the Surprising Minds exhibit, you can do exactly that! Come watch a 30-second video clip while we record your eyes up close. Then we'll replay the recording so that you can see what your eyes do when you watch movies, or look at the world!

The software used to run the interactive station can be found in [the Surprising Minds Exhibit github repository](https://github.com/everymind/SurprisingMinds-Exhibit). 

Our analyses of the exhibit's datasets can be found in [the Surprising Minds Analysis github repository](https://github.com/everymind/SurprisingMinds-Analysis).
