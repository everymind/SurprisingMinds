## What is behavior?

Behavior is an action you take to control the consequences of your environment on yourself. So behavior isn't just any action that a body makes; it is a movement with a purpose that is relevant to the needs and desires of that specific body. 

## What do we mean by 'in the wild'? 

When we talk about behaviors that happen 'in the wild', we are referring to what are often called 'natural behaviors', or actions that are relevant to an animal moving about freely in its natural environment. 

## Why does neuroscience need to study behavior in the wild?

The last few decades of neuroscience research have made it clear that neurons are always active in a living body, even during sleep and before birth. Movements of any kind always cause neural activity somewhere in the nervous system, regardless of whether those movements are part of a natural behavior or not. Certain non-movements, like posture, can even cause neural activity because of the purpose they serve to the organism, not because a body part is visibly moving. 

Most of our current knowledge about neural activity comes from studying brain tissue in a petri dish. These neurons have been disconnected from the bodies that provide them with purpose to their activities and information about the environment they must navigate and survive. In a way, these neurons are "deaf, blind, and mute". In the same way that a deaf, blind, and mute human might display behavior that is significantly different from that of a hearing, seeing, and talking human, we must assume that the activity patterns of a "brain in a dish" are also significantly different from the activity patterns of a "brain in a body" -- or we must prove methodically that such an assumption isn't true.
